I'm on my way from misery to happiness today 
I'm on my way from misery to happiness today 
I'm on my way to what I want from this world 
And years from now you'll make it to the next world 
And everything that you receive up yonder 
Is what you gave to me the day I wandered 

I took a right, I took a right turning yesterday 
I took a right, I took a right turning yesterday 
I took the road that brought me to your home town 
I took the bus to streets that I could walk down 
I walked the streets to find the one I'd looked for 
I climbed the stair that led me to your front door 

And now that I don't want for anything 
I'd have Al Jolson sing I'm sitting on top of the world 

I'll do my best, I'll do my best to do the best I can 
I'll do my best, I'll do my best to do the best I can 
To keep my feet from jumping from the ground dear 
To keep my heart from jumping through my mouth dear 
To keep the past, the past and not the present 
To try and learn when you teach me a lesson 

And now that I don't want for anything 
I'd have Al Jolson sing I'm sitting on top of the world

I'm on my way from misery to happiness today 
I'm on my way from misery to happiness today 
I'm on my way to what I want from this world 
And years from now you'll make it to the next world 
And everything that you receive up yonder 
Is what you gave to me the day I wandered 

I'm on my way to what I want from this world 
And years from now you'll make it to the next world 
And everything that you receive up yonder 
Is what you gave to me the day I wandered 

I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
